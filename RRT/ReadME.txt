For this assignment, I've decided to use the RRT algorithm. 
In particular, after having sampled the configuration, the nearest is searched and a the configuration distant step_size from the nearest in the direction of the sample has been chosen.

To run test the script, just execute rrt.py in the code folder.

NOTE: the seed is not fixed, so the result changes every time the code is executed!
